Data feeder:
------------

- check consistency between not Completed jobs in database and current status
  - dataimport should have feature to check if there are jobs: not Completed and not in qstat output
- Reasonable initial data (let user edit it during installation)
- node coeficients (walltime, cputime)


Web interface:
--------------

- create two version of graphs - small for overviews and big for whole page
- make colors configurable for any basic entity (queue, user, subcluster)
- suspicious jobs:
  - big difference between current time - start time and walltime

Database:
---------

- mysql separation on job table (not possible with the indexes, better try index on timestamps)
