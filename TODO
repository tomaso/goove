Data feeder:

- check consistency between not Completed jobs in database and current status
- create two version of graphs - small for overviews and big for whole page
- First page (at least proposal)
- Reasonable initial data (let user edit it during installation)
- make colors configurable for any basic entity (queue, user, subcluster)
