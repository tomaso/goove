Data feeder:
------------

- check consistency between not Completed jobs in database and current status
  - dataimport should have feature to check if there are jobs: not Completed and not in qstat output
- Reasonable initial data (let user edit it during installation)
- node coeficients (walltime, cputime)
- make the daemon stuff configurable (ini file)

- ! Let the daemon run on elf !


Web interface:
--------------

- create two version of graphs - small for overviews and big for whole page
- make colors configurable for any basic entity (queue, user, subcluster)
- let the queue graph select between days, weeks and months aggregation

Database:
---------

- mysql separation on job table (not possible with the indexes, better try index on timestamps)
- make sure TorqueServer is only one
