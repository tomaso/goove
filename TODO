Data feeder:
------------

- check consistency between not Completed jobs in database and current status
  - dataimport should have feature to check if there are jobs: not Completed and not in qstat output
- Reasonable initial data (let user edit it during installation)
- node coeficients (walltime, cputime)
- make the daemon stuff configurable (ini file)

- Let the daemon run on elf
- check consistency between accounting events and jobs

- remove xml parsing of jobs, let the web interface to poll job status only if it is running
and if a user asks for details (we can store last update at Running job and cache data in DB via model methods)

- when a Job is not started yet and deleted it does not have valid start_time and comp_time, this can be propagated
from accounting events (example at fzu site: 3235577)

- FIX node renaming and merging nodes

Web interface:
--------------

- create two version of graphs - small for overviews and big for whole page
- make colors configurable for any basic entity (queue, user, subcluster)
  - use colors when they are configured
- let the queue graph select between days, weeks and months aggregation
- move jobs/statistics to queues/pie chart
- with graph, draw also html table with results
- list completed jobs on node detail page in pages not the entire list
- administration interface

- The main form for querying db for finished jobs is /trqacc/jobs/completed_listing
  - make this form much richer and configurable
  - aborted jobs in recent time period (per node/queue/user)

- Be much faster with http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.QuerySet.select_related

- Nice color tool: http://colorschemedesigner.com/

- Prettier graphs with http://code.google.com/apis/charttools/docs/choosing.html

- User detail, grid user detail, group detail, queue detail (common philosophy)
- enhance detail page (for node, queue and user) with some tables and graphs

- Sessions - store status of node

- We should have a page with failed jobs (not Exited, Exited with error etc.)

- We should return most pages with no-cache

Database:
---------

- check that TorqueServer is used properly (per queue etc.)

Overview Mode
-------------

- Connect to nagios (via mklive)
